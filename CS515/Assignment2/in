The Vigenere encryption was the creation of the French diplomat, Blaise de Vigenere, 1523-1596. Like Caesar and all the cryptographers that followed, he did not visualize the cipher in modular arithmetical terms. Rather he viewed the cypher as a substitution cipher where a different alphabet was used for the next letter of the message, with the alphabets repeating periodically --- according to some key.
